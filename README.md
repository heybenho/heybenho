# Ben Ho - Data Analysis Portfolio

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ben! I'm currently a Senior Fund Analyst for UC Berkeley's University Development and Alumni Relations department. I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Business Administration, with emphases in Finance and Organization & Management. With over 3 years of experience in this role, as well as other roles, I've realized my passion for working with data. For this reason, I've decided to pursue a career in Data Analysis.

This is a repository that I've created to showcase my skills and projects that I've accomplished in pursuit of my passion, as well as track my progress.
